== Test rig for mobile CSS3 media queries

Simple rig for testing mobile CSS3 media queries in the browser thus saving:

    Resizing browser to activate the queries
    Deploying code to multiple devices

It uses an iFrame to represent the target device screen size and some simple controls to flip the orientation and switch between screen sizes.

Place your application in the /apps directory and change the path in the 'placeContent' method of /scripts/main.js to set it as the iFrame src.

Alternatively you can append a query url to have it load directly in the iFrame, eg. 

    "http://www.papersnail.co.uk/sandbox/shell/index.html?http://news.bbc.co.uk"

A good example to try here is "http://www.colly.com/" which features a modular design that is well-suited to scaling to different device resolutions and also makes good use of CSS3 media queries.

Another excellent example is "http://hicksdesign.co.uk/ which has a really nice fluid layout that scales right down to QVGA.

Obviously applications being developed can be run directly in the browser as well. 
The test rig just allows easy verification of CSS across different device screen sizes and orientations.
